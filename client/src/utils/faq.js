        title: "How much blood is taken?",
        body: "For a whole blood donation, approximately 0.5 L of blood is collected. For donations of other blood products, such as platelet or plasma, the amount collected depends on your height, weight and platelet count."
    },
    {
        title: "Are the history questions necessary every time I donate?",
        body: "Yes, since this helps to ensure the safest possible blood supply. All donors must be asked the screening questions at each donation. Both AABB and FDA regulations specifically require that all blood donors complete the donor history questionnaire on the day of donation and prior to donating."
    },
    {
        title: "If I was deferred once before, am I still ineligible to donate?",
        body: "Your blood donor center will inform you if you are permanently deferred or temporarily deferred. The deferral time depends upon the reason for deferral. Prior to each donation, you will be given a mini-physical and medical interview. At that time, it will be determined if you are eligible to donate blood on that day."
    },
    {
        title: "Can I still donate if I have high blood pressure?",
        body: "Yes, if your blood pressure falls within the limits set by FDA regulations."
    },
    
    {
        title: "If I just received a flu shot, can I donate blood?",
        body: "Yes. There is no waiting period to donate after receiving a flu shot."
    },
    {
        title: "What if I'm taking aspirin or medication prescribed by my doctor?",
        body: "Your blood donor center can best answer your questions. We recommend that you call the blood donor center ahead of time to inquire about any medications you are taking. Aspirin and ibuprofen will not affect a whole blood donation. However, apheresis platelet products can be affected if aspirin or aspirin products are taken 48 hours prior to donation. Many other medications are acceptable."
    },
    {
        title: "If I have a cold or the flu, can I donate blood?",
        body: "No, blood centers require that you be in good health (symptom-free) and feeling well."
    },
    {
        title: "How long will the actual donation process take?",
        body: "The entire donation process, from registration to post-donation refreshments, takes about one hour. The actual donation takes about 5-10 minutes."
    },
    {
        title: "What can you do if you aren't eligible to donate?",
        body: "While a given individual may be unable to donate, he or she may be able to recruit a suitable donor. Blood banks are always in need of volunteers to assist at blood draws or to organize mobile blood drives. In addition, monetary donations are always welcome to help ensure that blood banks can continue to provide safe and adequate blood to those in need."
    },
    {
        title: "Does donated blood stay on the shelf indefinitely until it is used?",
        body: "No. Each unit of whole blood is separated into several components. Red blood cells may be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of 42 days, or frozen for up to 10 years. Platelets are stored at room temperature and may be kept for a maximum of five to seven days. Fresh frozen plasma is kept in a stored frozen state for up to one year. Cryoprecipitated AHF is stored frozen for up to one year. Granulocytes must be transfused within 24 hours of donation."
    },
    {
        title: "Why are there often blood shortages?",
        body: "Most blood centers strive to maintain an optimum inventory level of a three-day supply. Due to unpredictable demands, the inventory often fluctuates hourly. When the blood supply drops below a three-day level, blood centers begin alerting local donors to increase the inventory to a safe operating level."
    },
    {
        title: "Is there such thing as artificial blood?",
        body: "Scientists have yet to find a successful substitute for human blood. This is why blood donors are so vital to the lives of those who are in need of blood."
    },
    {
        title: "Who needs blood?",
        body: "The need for blood is great. Every day in the U.S., approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells are required in hospitals and emergency treatment facilities for patients with cancer and other diseases, for organ transplant recipients, and to help save the lives of accident/trauma victims. In addition, nearly 5,000 platelet units and 6,500 units of plasma are also needed. In 2017, nearly 16 million blood components were transfused. With an aging population and advances in medical treatments and procedures requiring blood transfusions, there is always a need for blood and blood components."
